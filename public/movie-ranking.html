<h3> Anne with an E (Series)</h3>
<P> 
This series was cringy sometimes cause anne is doing some embarassing things but it's also very comforting and Educational. I would love to forget about it and watch it again like its the first time.
</P>
<h3> How to train your Dragon (Movie)</h3>
<p> 
This movie was very much comforting always made me cry even though there's nothing to cry about. I watched all Movies and it all made me cry.
</p>
<h3> Howl's moving Castle (Movie)</h3>
<p>
    Also very comforting and every time I watch it I learn new things that i didn't notice the first few times I watched it.
